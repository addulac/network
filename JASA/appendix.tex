\begin{proof}[Proof of proposition \ref{th:me2mg}]
for a given distribution $P$ under a model $M_g$ one has : 
if a distribution $P$ is bursty in $\M_g$ : one has
\begin{equation*}
    p(y \geq n+1 | y \geq n, \M_g) = \int_{\M_e} P(y \geq n+1 | y \geq, \M_e) P(\M_e) d\M_e
\end{equation*}

Let's denote the discrete derivate of a fonction $f$  as $\Delta_n f(n) = f(n+1) -f(n)$.

Concerning the burstiness of $P$ one has : 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_n P(y \geq n+1 | y \geq n, \M_g) = \int_{\M_e}\Delta_n P(y \geq n+1 | y \geq n, \M_e) P(\M_e)d\M_e
\end{equation}

As $P(\M_e)$ is stricly positive, the proposition is straitforward.
\end{proof}



\begin{proof}[Proof of proposition \ref{th:ldegree_exp_me}]
For IMMSB : ~\\

one as 
$D_{ik} = \sum_{j\in\mathcal{V}} \hat f_{ik} \hat \phi_{kk} \hat f_{jk} = \hat f_{ik} \sum_{j\in\mathcal{V}} \hat \phi_{kk} \hat f_{jk}$

And from $DP$ property on has
$P(\hat f_{ik} \geq x' + \epsilon | \hat f_{ik} \geq x', \M_e)$ is increasing with $x'$

Setting $x = x' (\sum_{j\in\mathcal{V}})$ one as that $P(D_{ik} \geq x + \epsilon | D_{ik} \geq x, \M_e)$ is increasing with $x$ since $\sum_{j\in \mathcal{V}} \hat \phi_{kk} \hat f_{jk}$ is positive and independat of $i$. (\textcolor{red}{but it depend on $k$ ?})


For ILFM :~\\

 let $C_{i,k} = |\{j \in V, \hat{f}_{jk} = \hat{f}_{ik} = 1\}|$. As the factor matrix is binary, one has:
%
\[ 
d_{i,k} = \sum_{j\in V} \sigma(\hat{f}_{ik} \hat{\Phi}_{kk} \hat{f}_{jk}) =  C_{i,k} (\sigma(\hat{\Phi}_{kk})-0.5) + \frac{N}{2}
\]
%
As $\hat{f}_{ik}$ is binary, there is no positive reinforcement effect: $C_{i,k}$ does not increase if $\hat{f}_{ik}=1$, thus ILFM does not satisfy local preferential attachment.
\end{proof}



\begin{proof}[Proof of proposition \ref{th:feature_exp_me}]

For IMMS : ~\\

one has $C_k = \sum_{i,j \in V^2} \hat f_{ik} \hat f_{jk}$
From the reinforcement of the DP process $C_k$ is bursty over $\M_e$.

For ILFM : ~\\

one has $C_k = \sum_{i \in V} \hat f_{ik}$
From the reinforcement of the IBP process $C_k$ is bursty over $\M_e$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof if proposition \ref{th:ldgree_mg}]
Assumiong exchangeability in  $\M_g$ on and that the $c_k$ relation that occurs in the class $k$.

\begin{equation}
P(d_{ik}=n | \M_g) = P( \cup I_k, \cup I_r)
\end{equation}

where $I_k$ represent the union of all sequnce of relation in the class $k$ where $d_{ik} = n$, where $I_r$ represent the union of ial sequences of relation outside the class $k$. Given $c_k$ and the exchangeability asumptions one has : 

\begin{equation}
P(d_{ik}=n | \M_g) = p(\cup I_r) \dbinom{c_k}{n} P( (y_{i0, k}=1,..,  y_{in, k}=1, y_{i(n+1), k}=0,...,y_{i(c_k), k}=0) | \M_g)
\end{equation}

Applying product rule, one has the following : 
\begin{equation}
\frac{P(d_{ik} = n+1)}{P(d_{ik} = n)} = \frac{c_k - n}{n+1} p(y_{ij}=1 | Y_i^{-ij, \M_g})
\end{equation}

Finally from the bernoulli-beta kernem in IMMSN, one has : 
\begin{equation}
p(y_{ij}=1 | Y_i^{-ij, \M_g}) = \frac{n+ \lambda_1}{C_k + \lambda_1 + \lambda_0}
\end{equation}

By solviing the second order equation, one can find that burstiness is satisfy iif the two condition are true : 
\begin{itemize}
\item $ \lambda_1 < \frac{c_k-1}{c_k+1}$
\item $ n < \frac{-3a + \sqrt{a(4c_k(a-b)+5a-4b)}}{2a}$
\end{itemize}
with $a = 1/(\lambda_1+\lambda_0)$ and $\lambda_1 / (\lambda_0+\lambda_0)$.

\end{proof}
